    <h3>Marinade:</h3>

    <ul>
       <li>3 ounces achiote paste</li>
       <li>1 white onion, chopped</li>
       <li>2 cloves garlic</li>
       <li>2 cups orange juice</li>
       <li>½ cup lemon juice</li>
       <li>¼ cup white vinegar</li>
       <li>2 tablespoons salt</li>
       <li>1 tablespoon ground black pepper</li>
       <li>1 tablespoon dried Mexican oregano</li>
       <li>5 pounds pork shoulder roast</li>
       <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
       <li>1 tablespoon lard</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Habanero Sauce:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 red onion, chopped</li>
        <li>3 habanero chiles, seeded and sliced</li>
        <li>¼ cup lemon juice</li>
        <li>¼ cup white vinegar</li>
        <li>1 cup lukewarm water</li>
        <li>sea salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>dried oregano</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Combine achiote paste, white onion, garlic, orange juice, lemon juice, 1/4 cup vinegar, 2 tablespoons salt, 1 tablespoon black pepper, and 1 tablespoon Mexican oregano in a blender; blend marinade until smooth.</li>
        <li>Rub pork with salt and pepper and place in a pressure cooker. Add lard and pour marinade over pork. Add 2 cups water. Close cooker securely and place pressure regulator over vent according to manufacturer's instructions. Heat to High heat until steam escapes in a steady flow and makes a whistling sound, about 5 minutes. Reduce heat to medium-low or low. Cook for 45 minutes from the start of the whistling sound. Let pressure release naturally according to manufacturer's instructions, 5 to 10 minutes. Unlock lid and transfer pork to a large platter.</li>
        <li>Prepare the habanero sauce while the meat is cooking. Combine red onion and habanero chiles in a gravy boat. Add 1/2 cup lemon juice, 1/4 cup white vinegar, and warm water. Season with salt, pepper, and dried oregano and mix until everything is well combined.</li>
        <li>Shred meat with 2 forks and return to the pressure cooker with the cooking juices. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat and cook uncovered until cooking juices have reduced, about 30 minutes. Serve with habanero sauce.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Cook's Notes:</h2>
    <p>For an even more intense flavor and if you have the time, cover meat with annatto sauce and marinate for about 8 hours.</p>
    <p>Be careful when handling the peppers as they are very spicy and you might want to wear gloves.</p>
