    <p>This Mexican pork stew can be served without the pork rinds and pigs' feet, if desired, but it will not be authentic. Posole may be served as a main dish with tortillas or crackers.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>2 pounds boneless pork loin, cubed</li>
        <li>8 ounces fried pork skins</li>
        <li>2 pig's feet</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon salt</li>
        <li>2 (15 ounce) cans white hominy, drained</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, crushed</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons chopped onion</li>
        <li>4 dried hot red chile pepper pods, seeded and diced</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Place meat, pork rinds, and pork shanks in a large kettle and add about 5 quarts of water or enough to cover meat. Add approximately 1 tablespoon salt and bring to a boil. Cook over medium heat for about 1 1/2 hours.</li>
        <li>Remove excess grease and set aside. Reserve liquid.</li>
        <li>Wash the posole very carefully until the water is clear so as to remove lime from kernels. Put in large kettle and cover with water. Boil until posole has popped.</li>
        <li>Mix meat, posole, rind, and shanks or pigs' feet. Add oregano, garlic, onion, and chile pods. Let simmer for about 1/2 hour.</li>
    </ol>
